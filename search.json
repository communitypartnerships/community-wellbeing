The CDC estimates that as much as 50% of individual health is due to “social, economic, and environmental factors, such as education, racism, discrimination, and housing.”4 That is, many disparities in health stem from inequities in the opportunities and resources needed to be healthy.\n\nHealth Insurance\nHealth insurance supports access to routine health care and provides some protection from unanticipated medical expenses. In Albemarle, 1 in 20 people do not have health insurance. Those without insurance are less likely to have a primary care provider, are more likely to delay or forgo needed care, and receive fewer preventative services.5 There are major demographic and geographic disparities in health insurance coverage across the county.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResidents with No Health Insurance by Census Tract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Census Tract\n      \n      Uninsured\n    \n  \n  \n    Albemarle High School\n\n31%\n    Oak Hill, Southwood\n\n20%\n    Commonwealth-Townwood-Berkmar\n\n13%\n    Southern Albemarle-Scottsville\n\n11%\n    Hydraulic\n\n10%\n    Barracks-Hessian Hills\n\n9%\n    Yancey Mills, Batesville\n\n7%\n    Berkmar Drive\n\n6%\n    Monticello, Carters Mountain\n\n6%\n    Hollymead\n\n4%\n    Carr's Hill-McCormick Road (UVA)\n\n4%\n    Old Trail\n\n4%\n    Charlottesville-Albemarle Airport\n\n3%\n    Stony Point-Keswick\n\n3%\n    Darden-Key West\n\n3%\n    Old Ivy-Darden School (UVA)\n\n3%\n    Western Ridge-Westhall\n\n3%\n    North Garden\n\n3%\n    Avon Street Ext.-Mill Creek\n\n3%\n    Free Union\n\n2%\n    Village of Rivanna\n\n2%\n    Dunlora-Stone Henge\n\n2%\n    Woodbrook-Carrsbrook\n\n2%\n    Ivy\n\n2%\n    Earlysville\n\n1%\n    Branchland\n\n1%\n    Crozet-Beaver Creek\n\n1%\n    Polo Grounds Road\n\n0%\n    Pantops\n\n0%\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The full profile provides additional health measures including life expectancy, food security, various health outcome and prevention metrics, and EMS responses to opiod overdoses for Albemarle County."

    "text": "Decent Standard of Living: Economic Security and Housing Profile\nLiving standards encompass access to the material needs of life—housing, security, goods and services. It is captured through measures on earnings, household income, homeownership and renting. Data on earnings and income contextualize the struggle some residents face to achieve economic stability and to afford basic necessities. Data on home ownership and housing burden point to the pressing challenges around housing affordability.\n\nEarnings and Income\nMedian earnings represent the midpoint of all household incomes, meaning half of households earn more and half earn less than that amount. The median is generally considered a more representative measure of typical income compared to the average, as it’s not affected by extreme outliers (very high or low incomes). The median personal earnings of Albemarle residents vary significantly by sex and by race.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedian Household Income\nWhile median personal earnings quantify well-being at the individual level, economic power is often pooled within family units. And many tax and policy interventions are monitored at the household level. Below, the median household income is provided to more directly relate financial well-being to the cost of living in the area.\n\nMedian Household Income by Census Tract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Census Tract\n      \n      Med Household Income\n    \n  \n  \n    Ivy\n\n$183,000\n    Earlysville\n\n$182,000\n    Polo Grounds Road\n\n$176,000\n    Darden-Key West\n\n$154,000\n    North Garden\n\n$149,000\n    Old Trail\n\n$146,000\n    Western Ridge-Westhall\n\n$141,000\n    Woodbrook-Carrsbrook\n\n$125,000\n    Charlottesville-Albemarle Airport\n\n$123,000\n    Hollymead\n\n$122,000\n    Berkmar Drive\n\n$121,000\n    Dunlora-Stone Henge\n\n$121,000\n    Village of Rivanna\n\n$119,000\n    Stony Point-Keswick\n\n$109,000\n    Free Union\n\n$103,000\n    Avon Street Ext.-Mill Creek\n\n$102,000\n    Monticello, Carters Mountain\n\n$98,000\n    Pantops\n\n$97,000\n    Albemarle High School\n\n$95,000\n    Yancey Mills, Batesville\n\n$92,000\n    Crozet-Beaver Creek\n\n$90,000\n    Southern Albemarle-Scottsville\n\n$90,000\n    Oak Hill, Southwood\n\n$74,000\n    Commonwealth-Townwood-Berkmar\n\n$70,000\n    Branchland\n\n$61,000\n    Barracks-Hessian Hills\n\n$59,000\n    Hydraulic\n\n$58,000\n    Carr's Hill-McCormick Road (UVA)\n\n$51,000\n    Old Ivy-Darden School (UVA)\n\n$41,000\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n As with personal earnings, data on median household income by race reveal troubling racial and ethnic disparities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStruggling Families: Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed (ALICE)\nComprehensive measures of financial hardship must consider both income and the broader cost of living: United Way developed the asset limited, income constrained, employed (ALICE) threshold for this purpose. The ALICE threshold is calibrated to specific localities, and represents the lowest possible income that households need to earn to afford their basic needs. These essentials include the costs of housing, healthcare, food, transportation, technology, taxes, and childcare.\nMany households with incomes below their local cost of living threshold, but above the federal poverty line may not be traditionally thought of as financially burdened. Because their incomes are above the federal poverty line, these households do not qualify for some federal assistance programs and their disadvantaged financial status is often overlooked by local governments. Inequities are amplified when local government interventions neglect the burdens of households who are working hard, and earning above the federal poverty threshold, but still not enough to meet their family’s basic needs.\nThe ALICE threshold, or the real cost of living, for Albemarle County has increased over the past decade. In 2010, this threshold for survival was $50,000 for households under 65; this grew to $75,000 in 2023. The percentages of households with incomes above the poverty line and under the ALICE threshold in Albemarle County differs across race and ethnicity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHousing: Renters and Owners\nHousing costs are one of the primary drivers of the rising costs of living.

    "text": "American Human Development Index (AHDI)\nThe American Human Development Index (AHDI) is a metric that assesses well-being along three axes: health, access to knowledge, and living standards. This metric was created by Measure of America of the Social Science Research Council to be estimated at geographic levels, such as states and counties, and to speak directly to the American context of an affluent democracy.2\nEach component of AHDI—health, access to knowledge, and living standards—is scored on a 0 to 10 scale for a specific geography.3 The AHDI is the average of these three scores: each component carries equal weight in the composite index as all carry equal importance for community well-being.\nThe following table shows AHDI for City of Charlottesville, Albemarle County, Virginia overall, and other localities that serve as comparative benchmarks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      American Human Development Index: Comparison Across Benchmark Localities\n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n      American HD Index\n      \n        Health\n      \n      \n        Access to Knowledge\n      \n      \n        Living Standards\n      \n    \n    \n      Life Expectancy (years)\n      At Least High School Diploma\n      At Least Bachelor’s Degree\n      Graduate Degree\n      School Enrollment\n      Median Earnings (2023 $)\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Local\n    \n    Charlottesville\n6.2\n79\n93%\n61%\n33%\n87%\n$38,285\n    Albemarle\n7.3\n82\n94%\n61%\n31%\n85%\n$51,922\n    \n      State & US\n    \n    Virginia\n5.8\n78\n91%\n41%\n18%\n76%\n$49,405\n    United States\n5.3\n78\n89%\n35%\n14%\n76%\n$44,587\n    \n      Benchmark Localities\n    \n    Alexandria City\n7.9\n82\n93%\n66%\n34%\n75%\n$73,247\n    Lynchburg City\n4.0\n74\n90%\n39%\n15%\n79%\n$29,505\n    Richmond City\n5.0\n75\n89%\n44%\n18%\n77%\n$41,143\n    Roanoke City\n3.8\n71\n90%\n29%\n11%\n73%\n$37,740\n    Williamsburg City\n3.5\n77\n93%\n48%\n22%\n93%\n$14,331\n    Arlington\n8.9\n85\n95%\n77%\n41%\n74%\n$88,306\n  \n  \n    \n      Data Sources: Life Expectancy: County Health Rankings, 2024.

That is, people are experiencing different outcomes in their health, education, and living standards depending on where they live.\nThe map below shows the AHDI for each census tract. Census tracts are areas determined by the U.S. Census Bureau to approximate neighborhoods; they are roughly equal in population and are bounded by major roads, rivers and railroad tracks.\n\nAmerican Human Development Index (AHDI) by Census Tract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Census Tract\n      \n      AHDI Value\n    \n  \n  \n    Fry's Springs\nLocust Grove\n\n7.8\n    Downtown Area\nGreenbrier-Meadows\n\n7.7\n    Woolen Mills\n\n6.7\n    Barracks-Rugby\n\n6.3\n    Belmont\n\n6.2\n    Rose Hill-Harris-Venable\n\n5.5\n    Fifeville-Cherry Avenue\n\n5.2\n    Ridge St.\n\n5.1\n    JPA-Fontaine\n\n4.1\n    10th & Page-Venable\n\n2.0\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n To better understand the nature of these discrepancies, the following figure shows the value for each individual AHDI component by census tract.\n\n\n\n\n\nNeighborhoods like Barracks-Rugby, JPA-Fontaine, and 10th & Page-Venable have a wide gap between their AHDI components, with high values in their education index and low values in earnings. Some of this can be explained by the off-campus student housing prevalent in these areas of the city, as students tend to make very low wages while enrolled full time at the University. However, the presence of low-earning students does not account for all of the apparent economic precarity.4\nUS Census data provides further detail on residents in these neighborhoods that helps us better understand the impact of student populations on poverty rates in the city. The following table shows several related measures for each tract surrounding the University: the overall poverty rate and the poverty rate for non-students, the percent of residents who received SNAP benefits within the past 12 months (in 2023), and the percent of residents considered “college-aged.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Student and non-student residents in neighborhoods surrounding the University\n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n      Overall Poverty Rate\n      Non-Student Poverty Rate\n      Received SNAP benefits\n      Residents 18-24 yrs.\n    \n  \n  \n    10th & Page-Venable\n61%\n41%\n22%\n55%\n    JPA-Fontaine\n65%\n21%\n7%\n76%\n    Barracks-Rugby\n20%\n9%\n2%\n37%\n    Charlottesville Overall\n23%\n14%\n10%\n20%\n  \n  \n    \n      Data Source: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5-year estimates, 2023\n\n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nThe above table makes it clear that in the area of 10th & Page-Venable, a historically Black neighborhood that now contains numerous rental properties frequently occupied by UVA students, there is significant financial need that cannot be attributed to student residents. Comparing poverty rates between non-student residents (41%) and the tract overall (61%) suggests that the overall poverty rate for this tract is not heavily impacted by students but reflects the high rate of intergenerational poverty in the neighborhood. In addition, 22% of residents are estimated to be receiving SNAP benefits—a significantly higher rate than the city overall. While over half of residents are college-aged, there are also around 550 families, 365 of these with children, living in the 10th & Page-Venable neighborhood.5\nCollege students do have an overall impact on the demographics and measures on poverty in Charlottesville. Over 20% of the population is between the ages of 18 and 24 years old, and the student population does appear to contribute to the rate of poverty in the city: the overall poverty rate is 23% while the rate for non-student residents is significantly less, at 14%. This pattern is especially apparent in the JPA-Fontaine and Barracks-Rugby areas.\nCollege student poverty is frequently transitional; the structural poverty facing our community is persistent. Charlottesville’s status as a college town can obscure the reality of structural poverty in many Charlottesville neighborhoods, particularly those that are University-adjacent."

    "section": "Decent Standard of Living: Economic Security and Housing Profile",
    "text": "Decent Standard of Living: Economic Security and Housing Profile\nLiving standards encompass access to the material needs of life—housing, security, goods and services. It is captured through measures on earnings, household income, homeownership and renting. Data on earnings and income contextualize the struggle some residents face to achieve economic stability and to afford basic necessities. Data on home ownership and housing burden point to the pressing challenges around housing affordability.\n\nEarnings and Income\nMedian earnings represent the midpoint of all household incomes, meaning half of households earn more and half earn less than that amount. The median is generally considered a more representative measure of typical income compared to the average, as it’s not affected by extreme outliers (very high or low incomes). The median personal earnings of Charlottesville residents vary significantly by sex and by race.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedian Household Income\nWhile median personal earnings quantify well-being at the individual level, economic power is often pooled within family units. And many tax and policy interventions are monitored at the household level. Below, the median household income is provided to more directly relate financial well-being to the cost of living in the area.\n\nMedian Household Income by Census Tract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Census Tract\n      \n      Med Household Income\n    \n  \n  \n    Greenbrier-Meadows\n\n$114,000\n    Belmont\n\n$102,000\n    Downtown Area\n\n$100,000\n    Locust Grove\n\n$89,000\n    Fry's Springs\n\n$88,000\n    Barracks-Rugby\n\n$83,000\n    Woolen Mills\n\n$81,000\n    Ridge St.\n\n$63,000\n    Rose Hill-Harris-Venable\n\n$62,000\n    Fifeville-Cherry Avenue\n\n$60,000\n    JPA-Fontaine\n\n$31,000\n    10th & Page-Venable\n\n$20,000\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n As with personal earnings, data on median household income by race reveal troubling racial and ethnic disparities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStruggling Families: Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed (ALICE)\nComprehensive measures of financial hardship must consider both income and the broader cost of living: United Way developed the asset limited, income constrained, employed (ALICE) threshold for this purpose. The ALICE threshold is calibrated to specific localities, and represents the lowest possible income that households need to earn to afford their basic needs. These essentials include the costs of housing, healthcare, food, transportation, technology, taxes, and childcare.\nMany households with incomes below their local cost of living threshold, but above the federal poverty line may not be traditionally thought of as financially burdened. Because their incomes are above the federal poverty line, these households do not qualify for some federal assistance programs and their disadvantaged financial status is often overlooked by local governments. Inequities are amplified when local government interventions neglect the burdens of households who are working hard, and earning above the federal poverty threshold, but still not enough to meet their family’s basic needs.\nThe ALICE threshold, or the real cost of living, for the City of Charlottesville has increased over the past decade. In 2010, this threshold for survival was $45,000 for households under 65; this grew to $69,000 in 2023. The percentages of households with incomes above the poverty line and under the ALICE threshold in Charlottesville differs across race and ethnicity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHousing: Renters and Owners\nHousing costs are one of the primary drivers of the rising costs of living. Housing is a significant expense, and in our housing affordability crisis there can be limited options for those families who are not earning enough to meet the area’s rising costs.\nZillow’s observed rent index (ZORI) is a measure of a locality’s representative market-rate rent.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany residents face economic hardship over rising rents, but these burdens are not equally shared.\n\nGross Rent by Census Tract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Census Tract\n      \n      Gross Rent\n    \n  \n  \n    Rose Hill-Harris-Venable\n\n$1,800\n    Woolen Mills\n\n$1,800\n    Fry's Springs\n\n$1,600\n    Locust Grove\n\n$1,600\n    Downtown Area\n\n$1,600\n    10th & Page-Venable\n\n$1,500\n    Barracks-Rugby\n\n$1,500\n    JPA-Fontaine\n\n$1,300\n    Greenbrier-Meadows\n\n$1,300\n    Belmont\n\n$1,200\n    Ridge St.\n\n$1,100\n    Fifeville-Cherry Avenue\n\n$1,100\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The impact of high rental costs on economic security is evident in estimates of how much of a household’s income goes towards housing. A household is rent burdened if 30% or more of their monthly income is spent on housing. If these costs are over 50% of household income, they are considered severely burdened by the cost of housing. The number of rent burdened households varies geographically across census tracts in Charlottesville.\n\n\n\n\n\nAddressing disparities in home ownership rates is critical for ensuring equitable access to economic stability and wealth-building opportunities for all Charlottesville residents.\n\n\nHome Ownership by Census Tract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Census Tract\n      \n      Percent Home Ownership\n    \n  \n  \n    Greenbrier-Meadows\n\n74%\n    Locust Grove\n\n69%\n    Belmont\n\n61%\n    Barracks-Rugby\n\n51%\n    Fry's Springs\n\n48%\n    Ridge St.\n\n47%\n    Woolen Mills\n\n45%\n    Fifeville-Cherry Avenue\n\n42%\n    Downtown Area\n\n36%\n    Rose Hill-Harris-Venable\n\n27%\n    10th & Page-Venable\n\n8%\n    JPA-Fontaine\n\n8%\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The full profile provides additional measures on living standards including ALICE thresholds for 2010-2023, and home ownership by race and ethnicity."

Residents bring a multitude of strengths, shape collective needs, and provide available resources to address those needs. Understanding who the community is composed of and how that composition is steadily evolving supports the creation of programs and use of resources that effectively invest in people. The profile begins by examining the population attributes of the estimated 169,533 residents of the city and county combined.1\n\nRace and Ethnicity\nAfrican Americans, free and enslaved, constituted the majority of the region’s population during the height of chattel slavery prior to the American Civil War. Post-Civil war, the proportion of African Americans in the area rapidly declined. Black men and women migrated away from the region. This movement was driven by opportunities opening in the North, and lack of opportunities in the South. Since that time, the majority of the population of Charlottesville and Albemarle has identified themselves in the census as white.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the past decade, the racial and ethnic composition of Charlottesville and Albemarle has remained steady even as the population has grown. In 2013, with a combined population of 144,300, 12% of residents identified as Black, 5% of residents identified as Asian, 5% as Hispanic or Latino, 2% identified with multiple races, and the remaining 74% identified as white. In 2023, with a combined population of 160,000, the proportion of residents by race and ethnicity exhibited minimal shifts.\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the full report for additional measures on language and linguistic isolation, and the prevalence of disabilities among residents in the combined Charlottesville-Albemarle Area."

    "text": "A Long and Healthy Life: Health Profile\n\nLife Expectancy\nThe primary AHDI indicator of health is life expectancy. Life expectancy at birth is the average number of years a baby born today is expected to live given current mortality patterns.\nThe average lifespan in the United States has declined in recent years, giving cause for concern: in 2022, U.S. life expectancy had fallen to 76.4 years, the lowest point in almost twenty years.4 Experts pointed to the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and rising rates of drug overdoses as major contributors to the striking national decline in life expectancy.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary Care and Mental Health Providers\nThe insufficient provision of primary care and mental health care are growing crises in the United States and are felt most acutely in rural areas of the country. At present, roughly 83 million people in the US lack access to a primary care physician.6 Similarly, there are long-standing and acute provider shortages within the American mental health care system: the amount of psychiatrists per 100,000 US individuals fell by about 10% from 2003 to 2013.7 In rural areas, roughly 80% of counties lack practicing psychiatrists.8 These trends provide context for understanding changes in mental health and primary care providers in the Charlottesville-Albemarle area.\nThe region’s supply of mental health care providers has grown steadily each year since 2016, a roughly 60% increase. At the same time, the region’s supply of primary care physicians has remained static. These trends parallel patterns in Virginia as a whole, though care provider rates are consistently higher in the Charlottesville-Albemarle region.\nHowever, the state as a whole is consistently ranked low on mental health workforce availability. The most recent report from Mental Health America ranks Virginia 38th, with an estimated 450 individuals for every mental health provider, compared to a national estimate of 340 individuals for every mental health provider.9\n\nPrimary Care and Mental Health Care Providers: 2016-2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Source: County Health Rankings, 2016-2024\n\n\n\nHealth Insurance\nAccess to multiple high quality health centers like UVA Health and Sentara Healthcare is a major contributor to well-being in Charlottesville and Albemarle. However, accessible and affordable medical services are not universally available to residents, as evidenced by the area’s stark disparities in health insurance coverage.\n\nResidents with No Health Insurance by Race: 2017-2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Source: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5-year estimates\n\n\n\nAccess to Parks and Exercise Opportunities\nAccess to parks and green spaces is increasingly understood as a vital component of health and wellness. The public health benefits of park access include physical, mental, and environmental well-being. In addition to serving as a place to exercise or experience nature, parks are essential components of regional and neighborhood-level identity, acting as important spaces for community building.\nOpportunities for exercise measures whether an individual has adequate access to parks or recreational facilities, defined here as living within a half mile of a park, within one mile of a recreational facility (if in an urban area), or within three miles of a recreational facility in a rural area.\n\nOpportunities for Exercise: Access to Parks or Recreational Facilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Source: County Health Rankings, 2020-2024"

    "text": "Access to Knowledge: Education Profile\nEducational attainment directly influences employment and earnings, which in turn influence access to housing, food, healthcare, transportation, and more. Charlottesville and Albemarle benefit from a highly educated population overall. However, overall high rates of formal education can conceal the challenges faced by those afforded fewer educational opportunities and support.\n\nDegree Attainment\nThe AHDI incorporates formal educational attainment: the percent of the adult population with a high school degree, with a bachelor’s degree, and with a graduate degree and the percent of the youth population enrolled in school. The figure below shows the percent of residents aged 25 and over who have attained each degree level across the last five years.\nBy these measures, the combined population of Charlottesville and Albemarle has seen increased educational attainment, especially in the percent of the adult population with a four-year college degree. This increase could reflect growth of education among residents, a shift in the composition of who lives in the city and the county, or a combination of both.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figure below shows how degree attainment varies across residents by race and ethnicity in the combined population. These differences may be due to multiple barriers to higher education, including affordability, geographic accessibility of college and differential experiences with secondary education institutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchool Enrollment\nSchool enrollment measures how many young people, ages 3 to 24 years, currently attend a public school, private school, college or university.10\nIn Charlottesville and Albemarle County, enrollment in formal schooling has remained steady across the last five years, from 84% in 2018 to 86% in 2023.

Access to affordable childcare and early childhood education is essential for working families, enabling parents, guardians, and other caring adults to maintain stable employment. Childcare and preschools are not tied to residential jurisdiction, so the availability of early childhood education centers and seats is best understood regionally.\nThe table below combines the locality reports from Child Care Aware of Virginia as of January 2025.

    "section": "Decent Standard of Living: Economic Security and Housing Profile",
    "text": "Decent Standard of Living: Economic Security and Housing Profile\nA decent standard of living is centered on income—a means to meet essential needs like housing, security, and food. Standard of living is captured in the AHDI through measures on earnings. This Charlottesville-Albemarle regional report supplements data on earnings and income with measures of housing availability, affordability, and stability, centering the basic need of safe shelter.\n\nEarnings and Income\nThe steady growth in median personal earnings between 2012 and 2023 speaks to the ongoing expansion of economic opportunities in Charlottesville and Albemarle. Median earnings represent the value for which half of workers earn more and half earn less. Consistent increases in median personal earnings are visible both before and after adjusting earnings for inflation.\n\n\n\n\n\nMedian earnings reflect the wages or salaries individuals receive from work. Median household income arises from the combined earnings of members of a household, along with other sources of income including interest and trusts, and retirement income and social security. There are significant racial and ethnic disparities in median household incomes in Charlottesville and Albemarle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere People Live and Work\nThe combined Charlottesville-Albemarle area enjoys a robust labor market. Not all local workers live within the city and county boundaries, and not all employed residents of the area work in the two localities. The figure below shows the number of working individuals who both live and work within the city and county boundaries, the number who live in the area but work outside of it, and the number who live outside of Charlottesville and Albemarle but work in the city and county limits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHousing: Renters and Owners\nIncome has a broad impact on the choices individuals make. Housing is a significant expense, and in our housing affordability crisis, there often are limited options for those whose wages are not rising enough to meet the regional costs of housing. The figures below show how many households in Charlottesville and Albemarle are homeowners or renters, and of those renters, how many are struggling to make rent.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Charlottesville and Albemarle, over half (59%) of households own their homes. Among the 41% of households who are renters, more than half—nearly 12,800 households—were rent-burdened to some degree. A household is considered to be rent-burdened if 30% or more of their monthly income is spent on housing. If these costs are over 50% of household income, they are considered severely burdened by the cost of housing. In our area, 27% of renters—over 6,700 households—were severely burdened.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvictions\nOne of the most severe consequences of rent-burden is eviction, or forced displacement from one’s home. Evictions are a major component of growing regional housing disparities and reflect broader statewide and national histories of exploitation and exclusion. The figure below shows both the number of eviction cases filed by landlord representatives in the Albemarle and Charlottesville General District Courts and the number of eviction judgments—cases granting an eviction.\nThe act of filing an eviction case alone has serious and well-documented consequences for tenants, even in instances when forceful removal does not occur.12 Tenants who have an eviction case in their legal record often experience long-term housing instability, as future landlords may use this to reject their housing application.\n\nCases Filed and Eviction Judgments within Local Court Jurisdictions: 2018-2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople Experiencing Homelessness\nThe City of Charlottesville and Albemarle County work to address homelessness in collaboration with the broader area’s Continuum of Care (CoC), the Blue Ridge Area Coalition for the Homeless (BRACH), which is the federally-required planning body that oversees the provision of services and programs for unhoused people in the region.13\nIn addition to administering federal funds, BRACH oversees the annual point-in-time (PIT) count for the region, which includes Greene, Fluvanna, Louisa, and Nelson, as well as Albemarle and Charlottesville.14 While the PIT count is the most consistent source of data on regional homelessness, it is widely recognized that the PIT count underestimates the true number of people experiencing homelessness.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiving Doubled Up\nThe most basic categories in the PIT count differentiate between ‘sheltered’ and ‘unsheltered’ homelessness, but these distinctions miss a variety of other living strategies, including doubling up. Living doubled up is defined as living with others because of economic hardship or housing loss and is precarious: a change in circumstances can quickly result in unsheltered homelessness.\nHomelessness is increasingly understood in terms of “cycling,” where vulnerable individuals repeatedly move into and out of stable housing.16 For many, doubling up is one stage of this broader cycle. New approaches to estimating and understanding the prevalence of doubling up are being developed, including estimates derived from American Community Survey microdata.17\nApplying those methods to our CoC region produces an annual estimate of 1,826 people living doubled up. Additional efforts are needed to more accurately assess the scale of doubling up specifically in Charlottesville and Albemarle, and to consider targeted interventions to support individuals experiencing this vulnerable living arrangement.\n\n\nMcKinney-Vento Act\nAn additional source for understanding the scope of homelessness locally comes from educational data. The McKinney-Vento Act (MVA) provides federal protections and resources for the educational rights of children and youth experiencing homelessness.18 To administer the program, state and local education agencies capture information on “children and youth who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence, including those who are sharing the housing of others due to loss of housing, economic hardship, or a similar reason; staying in motels, trailer parks, or camp grounds due to the lack of an adequate alternative; staying in shelters or transitional housing; or sleeping in cars, parks, abandoned buildings, substandard housing, or similar settings.”19 As such, it captures a wider range of unhoused living arrangements than the PIT count, but only for children and youth.\nMcKinney-Vento data for the combined Charlottesville City Schools and Albemarle County Public Schools captures a notably higher number of young people experiencing homelessness than what is evident in the PIT count. While the data records a decline in students experiencing homelessness in the 2019-20 and 2020-21 school years, the data for these years were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The remote and hybrid learning at the onset of the pandemic reduced the ability for educational staff to recognize housing instability among their students. In the 2022-2023 school year, the most recent data available indicates the number of children in our school systems identified as homeless began trending back up to pre-pandemic levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBed Capacity Among Organizations Serving Unhoused Residents\nBRACH coordinates an annual HUD-mandated count of beds provided by local homeless services organizations for people experiencing homelessness.20 This Housing Inventory Count (HIC) captures the number of year-round beds for emergency shelter and transitional housing, seasonal beds, like those provided through PACEM during the winter months, and beds associated with permanent supportive housing programs.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe seasonal bed capacity is provided through PACEM and has been fairly stable during this period. The decline in 2021 reflects the transition away from congregate care during the COVID-19 pandemic, given the highly contagious nature of the virus.\nThe availability of emergency shelter and transitional housing declined in 2016 and 2017 in response to HUD’s decision to move funds from transitional housing and toward rapid rehousing programs. In the region, the count of transitional housing beds decreased by about 30 in 2016 and again in 2017, as funding impacted the Salvation Army’s Center of Hope and other similar programs. During the pandemic in 2020 and 2021, the availability of emergency beds increased, primarily due to the decision to use the hotel at Premier Circle as a non-congregate emergency shelter and a site for supportive services. The Premier Circle project was discontinued in 2023 to prepare for the conversion of the site to a new low-income and supportive housing community, in alignment with the original intent.\nWhile emergency shelter and transitional housing in the region has seen some volatility, the number of beds associated with permanent supportive housing has been increasing. The opening of The Crossings in 2012 added a stable capacity of 30 new beds in 2013, increasing to 35 in 2016. In addition, multiple programs launched or grew in 2018, though many of these new beds are targeted towards specific populations, including programs for veterans experiencing homelessness, for individuals with serious mental illness, and for people living with HIV/AIDS. In addition, since 2016, the Haven has had funding for about 25 beds through rapid rehousing programs."
